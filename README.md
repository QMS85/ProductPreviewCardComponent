## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

### Screenshot

![](ProductPreviewCardComponent)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned  
What are you most proud of, and what would you do differently next time?
What I'm Most Proud Of...
Responsive Design Excellence - The card seamlessly adapts from mobile to desktop layouts using CSS Grid/Flexbox and picture elements for optimal image loading.
Accessibility Focus - Screen reader support with .sr-only class, proper ARIA labels, and keyboard navigation handling.
Modern CSS Practices - Custom properties for consistent theming, proper semantic HTML structure, and smooth transitions.
Interactive Feedback - The "Add to Cart" button provides visual confirmation with temporary state changes.
Performance Optimization - Lazy loading images and responsive image serving with different assets for mobile/desktop.
What I Would Do Differently Next Time
Error Handling - Add more robust error handling for image loading failures and network issues.
State Management - Implement actual cart functionality with local storage or session management.
Animation Polish - Add micro-interactions like hover effects on the card itself or loading states.
Testing - Include unit tests for the JavaScript functionality.
SEO Optimization - Add structured data markup for better search engine understanding of the product.
What challenges did you encounter, and how did you overcome them?
Here are the key challenges I encountered and how they were overcome:
Responsive Image Handling Challenge:
Serving different images for mobile vs desktop while maintaining performance and quality.
My Solution: I Used the <picture> element with <source> media queries to serve optimized images:

On Desktop: Higher resolution image for larger screens.
On Mobile: Smaller, optimized image for mobile devices.
Lazy loading implementation for better performance.
CSS Layout Complexity Challenge:
Creating a card that works seamlessly on both mobile (stacked) and desktop (side-by-side) layouts.
My Solution: I Implemented a mobile-first approach with CSS Grid/Flexbox:

On Mobile: Single column layout with image on top
On Desktop: Two-column layout using flex-direction: row Smooth transitions between breakpoints at 768px  

Accessibility Implementation Challenge:  
Making the component usable for screen readers and keyboard navigation.
My Solution: I Added comprehensive accessibility features:
.sr-only class for screen reader-only content.
Proper ARIA labels on interactive elements.
Keyboard event handling for Enter and Space keys.
Focus management with visible focus indicators.  

Interactive Feedback Challenge:
Providing user feedback when the "Add to Cart" button is clicked without a backend.
My Solution: I Created a temporary state change system:
- Button text changes to "Added!" with checkmark icon.
- Temporary disabled state with visual opacity change.
- 2-second timeout to reset to original state.
- Console logging for debugging.  

- Server Setup for Development Challenge:
Setting up a proper development server to serve static files with correct MIME types.  

My Solution: I Created a custom Node.js server with:  
- Proper MIME type handling for different file extensions.
- CORS headers for development.
- Error handling for missing files.  
- Port configuration for my IDE environment.  
- Performance Optimization Challenge:  
Ensuring fast loading and smooth user experience.  

My Solution: I Implemented several optimizations:  
- Lazy loading for images.
- CSS custom properties for consistent theming.
- Minimal JavaScript with efficient event handling.
- Graceful error handling for failed image loads.
